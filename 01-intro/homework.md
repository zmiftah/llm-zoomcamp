## Homework: Introduction

In this homework, we'll learn more about search and use Elastic Search for practice.

## Q1. Running Elastic 

Run Elastic Search 8.17.6, and get the cluster information. 

What's the `version.build_hash` value? 

**The answer: `dbcbbbd0bc4924cfeb28929dc05d82d662c527b7`**

## Q2. Indexing the data

Index the data in the same way as was shown in the course videos. Make the `course` field a keyword and the rest should be text.

Which function do you use for adding your data to elastic? 

**The answer: `index`**

## Q3. Searching

Now let's search in our index. 

We will execute a query "How do execute a command on a Kubernetes pod?". 

Use only `question` and `text` fields and give `question` a boost of 4, and use `"type": "best_fields"`.

What's the score for the top ranking result?

**The answer: `31.973522`**

## Q4. Filtering

Now ask a different question: "How do copy a file to a Docker container?".

This time we are only interested in questions from `machine-learning-zoomcamp`.

Return 3 results. What's the 3rd question returned by the search engine?

**The answer: `How do I copy files from a different folder into docker containerâ€™s working directory?`**

## Q5. Building a prompt

Now we're ready to build a prompt to send to an LLM. 

What's the length of the resulting prompt? (use the `len` function)

**The answer: `3113`**

## Q6. Tokens (Problem with tiktoken)

When we use the OpenAI Platform, we're charged by the number of 
tokens we send in our prompt and receive in the response.

The OpenAI python package uses `tiktoken` for tokenization:

```bash
pip install tiktoken
```

Let's calculate the number of tokens in our query: 

```python
encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4o")
```

Use the `encode` function. How many tokens does our prompt have?

* 120
* 220
* 320
* 420

Note: to decode back a token into a word, you can use the `decode_single_token_bytes` function:

```python
encoding.decode_single_token_bytes(63842)
```

## Bonus: generating the answer (ungraded)

Let's send the prompt to OpenAI. What's the response?  

Note: you can replace OpenAI with Ollama. See module 2.

## Bonus: calculating the costs (ungraded)

Suppose that on average per request we send 150 tokens and receive back 250 tokens.

How much will it cost to run 1000 requests?

You can see the prices [here](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)

On June 17, the prices for gpt4o are:

* Input: $0.005 / 1K tokens
* Output: $0.015 / 1K tokens

You can redo the calculations with the values you got in Q6 and Q7.
